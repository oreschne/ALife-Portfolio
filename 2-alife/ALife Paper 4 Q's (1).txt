* Given that there is (and more than likely, HAS to be) a lot of content from the internet, is it even possible/realistic to have no biases of any sort?

* While having large datasets to pull from provides a very obvious benefit, would there be any benefits from scaling back any of these models to fit more niches, and possibly eliminating the “noise”?
